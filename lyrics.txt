And so I feel open, let's go
I can be myself, I can be myself
Fear has kept me closed
The fear

I need your melody, your mourning
Not gonna go down falling
I can be myself, I can be myself
The fear has kept me closed
The fear has left me cold

Proving myself, I open myself
Listening to me now
I open myself, proving myself
Listening to me now
Only me now

I need your melody, your mourning
Not gonna go down falling
I need your melody, your mourning
I can be myself, I can be myself
The fear has kept me closed
The fear has let me go

Proving myself, I open myself
Listening to me now
I open myself, proving myself
Listening to me now
Only me now

I need your melody, your mourning
I feel open, less cold
I need your melody, your mourning
I can be myself, I can be myself
The fear has let me go
The fear has let me go
